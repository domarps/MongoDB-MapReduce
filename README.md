# mapReduce
CS 410 MP :  A Javascript implementation of MapReduce using the MongoDB

## Summary
We have crawled a data set of resumes from [Indeed](www.indeed.com) for you and saved it as a big JSON file(available on request). Implemented the MapReduce wordCount program using **partial computation** and formulated a **pointwise mutual information**(PMI) calculation algorithm to measure semantic similarity.

## Instructions
First, install mongoDB
```bash
load("PMI.js")
```
